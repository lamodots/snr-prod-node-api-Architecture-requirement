# 📦 Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL Project Template

A NestJS-inspired architecture pattern implemented in Node.js + Express.js with Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL (Neon free tier). This template demonstrates how to build scalable, testable, and maintainable APIs using the Modular + Layered + Dependency Injection (DI) approach.

## 🚀 Features

- Modular structure → Feature-based modules (e.g., users, products)
- Layered architecture → Clear separation of concerns: Controllers → Services → Repositories → Database
- Manual Dependency Injection → Explicit DI chain for better testability and flexibility
- Prisma ORM integration → Type-safe queries, migrations, and PostgreSQL support
- REST API endpoints → Example CRUD operations for User entity
- Ready-to-use template → Easily extendable for new modules

### Modular Structure

Break your app into feature-based modules

```bash
src/
  users/
    users.model.ts           # TypeScript interface or Prisma type for User
    users.repository.ts      # Handles DB queries via Prisma
    users.service.ts         # Business logic layer
    users.controller.ts      # HTTP request handlers
    users.routes.ts          # Route definitions (uses controller methods)
    users.module.ts          # Factory function to wire DI and return router
  products/
    products.model.ts        # TypeScript interface or Prisma type for Product
    products.repository.ts   # Handles DB queries via Prisma
    products.service.ts      # Business logic layer
    products.controller.ts   # HTTP request handlers
    products.routes.ts       # Route definitions (uses controller methods)
    products.module.ts       # Factory function to wire DI and return router
  services/
    emails/
      email.service.ts       # Business logic for sending emails

    prisma.ts                # Shared Prisma client instance
    middleware/
      errorHandler.ts        # Centralized error handling
      requestLogger.ts       # Optional: logs incoming requests
    utils/
      formatResponse.ts      # Optional: helper for consistent API responses
  generated/                 # Auto-generated types or artifacts (e.g., Prisma client)
  app.ts                     # Initializes Express app and registers modules
  server.ts                  # Starts the server                 # Starts the server

```

### 📂 Folder & File Explanations

`src/users/`
This is a feature module for the `users` domain. Each feature gets its own folder, keeping code modular and organized.

- `users.model.ts`
  - What it does: Defines the shape of the User entity (TypeScript interface or Prisma schema reference).
  - Why we have it: Provides type safety and a single source of truth for user data.
  - Best practices:
    - Keep models simple and focused on data structure.
    - Use TypeScript interfaces or Prisma-generated types.
- `users.repository.ts`
  - What it does: Handles database operations (CRUD) using Prisma.
  - Why we have it: Separates persistence logic from business logic.
  - Best practices:
    - Keep repository methods small and reusable.
    - Never mix business rules here — only DB queries.
- `users.service.ts`
  - What it does: Contains business logic (validation, transformations, orchestration).
  - Why we have it: Keeps controllers thin and makes logic reusable.
  - Best practices:
    - Services should call repositories, not the database directly.
    - Keep services stateless where possible.
- `users.controller.ts`
  - What it does: Handles HTTP requests/responses. Maps routes to service methods.
  - Why we have it: Separates API layer from business logic.
- Best practices:
  - Controllers should be thin — delegate to services.
  - Handle request validation and response formatting here.
- `users.routes.ts`
  - What it does: Defines Express routes for the users module.
  - Why we have it: Keeps route definitions modular and easy to register in `app.ts.`
- Best practices:

  - Group related routes together.
  - Apply middleware (auth, validation) at the route level.

- `src/common/`
  Shared utilities and configurations used across modules.

- `prisma.ts`
  - What it does: Creates a single Prisma client instance.
  - Why we have it: Prevents multiple DB connections and centralizes DB access.
- Best practices:
  - Export one Prisma client for the whole app.
  - Handle connection lifecycle properly (disconnect on shutdown).
- `/middleware`
  - What it does: Contains Express middleware (e.g., logging, error handling, validation).
  - Why we have it: Keeps cross-cutting concerns separate from business logic.
- Best practices:
  - Centralize error handling here.
  - Use middleware for request validation, security (CORS, rate limiting).
- `/utils`
  - What it does: Helper functions (e.g., formatters, constants, reusable logic).
  - Why we have it: Avoids duplication and keeps code DRY.
- Best practices:
  - Keep utilities pure (no side effects).
  - Organize by domain (e.g., dateUtils.ts, stringUtils.ts).

#### Root Files

- `app.ts`
  - What it does: Initializes Express app, registers middleware and routes.
  - Why we have it: Central place for app configuration.
- Best practices:
  - Keep app.ts focused on wiring modules together.
  - Don’t put business logic here.
- `server.ts`
  - What it does: Starts the server and listens on a port.
  - Why we have it: Separates app configuration (app.ts) from runtime execution.
- Best practices:
  - Keep this file minimal — just start the app.
  - Useful for testing (you can import app.ts without starting the server).

#### 🎯 Why This Structure?

- Modular: Each feature (users, products, etc.) is isolated.
- Layered: Clear separation of concerns (Controller → Service → Repository → DB).
- Reusable: Shared logic lives in `common/`.
- Maintainable: Easy to scale as the project grows.
- Testable: Each layer can be unit-tested independently.

#### ✅ Best Practices Summary

- Keep controllers thin → delegate to services.
- Keep services focused → orchestrate logic, call repositories.
- Keep repositories clean → only database queries.
- Use manual DI → instantiate dependencies explicitly for clarity.
- Centralize middleware & utils → avoid duplication.
- Separate `app.ts` (setup) and `server.ts` (execution) → improves testability.
